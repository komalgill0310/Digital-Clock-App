# Summary
<font size=5>This is the first project where I used JavaScript to give some functionality to my Digital Clock. In this application, I first created rough HTML and CSS and then I started working on that how can I get the local date and time. Later on, I started working on to make the clock Tick. Also, in JS the getHours() methods shows the hour from 0-23H(military time clock) and I convertrd the military clock to regular clock. Lastly, I made the time which is less than 10 followed by the leading zeroes, and converted the dates format to ordinal numbers. It was a great start towards learning JS. </font>
